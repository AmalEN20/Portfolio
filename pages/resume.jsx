          I am Amal, a recent graduate of the coding bootcamp at the University
          of Washington. Currently, I am studying programming with a strong
          aspiration to become a full stack developer. Through the bootcamp, I
          gained a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development,
          equipping me with essential skills and knowledge. To further enhance
          my abilities, I am immersing myself in a comprehensive curriculum that
          covers a wide range of programming concepts. My dedication to
          continuous learning drives me to seek opportunities where I can apply
          my skills and gain real-world experience. I am particularly passionate
          about becoming a full stack developer because it allows me to handle
          both the front-end and back-end aspects of a project. This versatility
          is crucial in creating well-rounded and impactful software solutions.
          Driven by my determination to excel in the field of software
          development, I am committed to honing my skills and expanding my
          knowledge. I actively engage in various projects and seek out
          challenges to continuously improve my abilities. With my strong
          foundation, unwavering drive, and eagerness to learn, I am confident
          that I will make a significant impact in the world of software
          development. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and
          look forward to contributing to the growth and innovation within the
          industry.
